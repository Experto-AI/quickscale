## Ultra-Minimal Beta (UMB) - v0.40.0: Quick Beta Launch with Feature Flags

**Goal**: Ship working beta in 1 week using feature flags to disable complex features while preserving all code.

**Philosophy**: Ship a **working demonstration** of core value, not a feature-complete platform.

**Single Success Metric**: `quickscale init myproject && cd myproject && docker-compose up` → fully functional SaaS app in 5 minutes.

### **Core-First Strategy: Feature Flags Instead of Code Deletion**

**Core Principle**: Keep all existing code but disable complex features through configuration.

**Implementation Approach**:
1. **Settings-Based Feature Flags**: Add `settings/feature_flags.py` with beta-safe defaults
2. **Conditional Code Execution**: Wrap complex features with `if settings.FEATURE_ENABLED:`
3. **Template Conditional Rendering**: Use `{% if ENABLE_FEATURE %}` in templates
4. **Test Markers**: Disable complex tests with `@pytest.mark.skipif(not settings.ENABLE_FEATURE)`

#### **Ultra-Minimal Beta Scope (1 Week Implementation)**

**Keep Only (Absolute Essentials)**:
1. **Generator Core**: `quickscale init` command, project template generation, Docker setup with PostgreSQL
2. **Basic Auth & UI**: User registration/login via django-allauth (no email verification), simple dashboard, minimal Bulma CSS
3. **Simple Credit Demo**: Fixed 100 credits per new user (no payment required), single demo service: "Text Length Counter", basic credit deduction
4. **Admin Essentials**: Django admin access, manual credit adjustment capability

**Disable via Feature Flags (Preserve All Code)**:
```python
# settings/feature_flags.py - Beta Configuration
ENABLE_STRIPE = False               # Disable payment processing
ENABLE_SUBSCRIPTIONS = False        # Hide subscription UI/logic
ENABLE_CREDIT_TYPES = False         # Single credit pool only
ENABLE_SERVICE_MARKETPLACE = False  # Show single demo service
ENABLE_ADVANCED_ADMIN = False       # Basic Django admin only
REQUIRE_EMAIL_VERIFICATION = False  # Optional login flow
ENABLE_API_ENDPOINTS = False        # Web UI only
ENABLE_ADVANCED_ERRORS = False      # Basic error pages
ENABLE_WEBHOOKS = False             # No webhook processing
ENABLE_SERVICE_GENERATOR = False    # Defer CLI commands
```

#### **7-Day Implementation Plan**

**Day 1-2: Feature Flag Implementation & Stabilization**
- Create settings/feature_flags.py with beta-safe defaults
- Wrap Stripe-related code with `if settings.ENABLE_STRIPE:`
- Add conditional template rendering for complex features
- Disable failing tests via pytest markers (not deletion)
- Fix database connection issues (standardize to port 5432)

**Day 3-4: Core Generator Polish**
- Test `quickscale init` on clean Ubuntu/macOS systems
- Verify Docker Compose setup works without errors
- Ensure database migrations run successfully
- Validate basic template rendering

**Day 5-7: End-to-End Validation**
- Install from pip on fresh systems
- Manual testing of complete user journey
- Fix any remaining critical issues
- Write simple one-page getting started guide

#### **Beta User Experience (Target: 5 Minutes)**
```bash
# Installation and setup
pip install quickscale
quickscale init my-saas-app
cd my-saas-app
docker-compose up

# Usage (web browser)
1. Open http://localhost:8000
2. Click "Register" → create account (no email verification)
3. See dashboard with "100 credits available"
4. Click "Demo Service" → enter text → submit
5. See result + "99 credits remaining"
6. Admin can login to Django admin and adjust credits
```

#### **Success Criteria**
- ✅ Generator works on Ubuntu, macOS, Windows
- ✅ Docker setup succeeds without PostgreSQL errors
- ✅ User registration and demo service work end-to-end
- ✅ Credit deduction functions correctly
- ✅ Zero critical bugs in 5-minute user journey
- ✅ Complete user journey works in under 5 minutes

## Implementation Notes

**Feature Flag Strategy**: All complex features should be developed behind feature flags to enable progressive rollout and safe rollback.

**Backward Compatibility**: Maintain API compatibility and provide clear migration paths for template updates.

**Quality Gates**: Each sprint must include comprehensive testing and documentation updates.

**User Feedback**: Regular feedback collection and incorporation throughout the development process.

The roadmap prioritizes shipping a working beta quickly (1 week) while preserving all development work through feature flags, then progressively enabling features based on real user feedback and market validation.
