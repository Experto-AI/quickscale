## Implementation Notes

**Feature Flag Strategy**: All complex features should be developed behind feature flags to enable progressive rollout and safe rollback.
**Quality Gates**: Each sprint must include comprehensive testing and documentation updates.

## Development Sprints

### Sprint 30: Core Generator Polish (v0.41.0) 

**Goal**: Ensure the core `quickscale init` generator works flawlessly across different environments

**Implementation Tasks**:
- [x] Create a webscraper with login capabilities to crawl the whole application to see if it renders ok.
      Must work in e2e tests and manual testing of a deployed generated project.

- [x] Generator Environment Testing: Set up clean testing environments, test `quickscale init myproject` from scratch, test with different project names and directories
- [x] Docker Compose Validation: Test Docker Compose startup, verify PostgreSQL container starts without errors, check network connectivity between containers
- [x] Database Migration Testing: Test initial migration on fresh PostgreSQL, verify all tables created correctly, test migration rollback scenarios
- [x] Default Data Setup: Verify default services are created on startup, test default admin user creation, validate initial credit allocation
- [x] Template Rendering Validation: Test all core templates render without errors, verify CSS/JS assets load correctly, test responsive design
- [x] Authentication Flow Testing: Test user registration with feature flags, verify login/logout functionality, test session management
- [x] Integration Testing: Test complete user onboarding flow, verify demo service execution, test credit deduction mechanism
- [x] Edge Case Handling: Test generator with special characters, existing files/directories, fix compatibility issues, resolve file permission issues
- [x] Using webscaraper, pages under /admin must not be checked for Bulma CSS, HTMX nor Alpine.js because they are original Django admin pages
- [x] Using webscaraper, for admin user, the existence of admin panel (/dashboard) must be validated as required (the link there must exist and the webpage must render OK)
- [x] code_quality.sh fix & ./run_tests.sh --failures-only
- [x] code_quality.sh critical & ./run_tests.sh --failures-only
- [x] code_quality.sh full & ./run_tests.sh --failures-only
- [x] python3 ./scripts/spot_duplicate_code.py
