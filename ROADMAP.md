## System Architecture Overview

The QuickScale credit system supports multiple payment models and credit types with flexible billing options. For complete details about the credit system architecture, consumption logic, and technical implementation, see the [Credit System Documentation](docs/CREDIT_SYSTEM.md).

**Key Features:**
- **Two Credit Types**: Pay-as-you-go (never expire) and subscription credits (monthly expiration)
- **Three Purchase Options**: Basic plan, Pro plan, and one-time credit purchases
- **Smart Consumption**: Subscription credits consumed first, then pay-as-you-go credits
- **Variable Costs**: Each service/product consumes configurable credit amounts
- **Real-time Tracking**: Complete usage and payment history for users and admins

## Development Sprints

---

### Sprint 7: Credit Type Priority System (v0.19.0)
**Goal**: Implement subscription credits consumed first, then pay-as-you-go

**Backend Implementation:**
- [X] Add credit expiration logic for subscription credits
- [X] Implement priority consumption (subscription credits first)
- [X] Update `consume_credits()` method with priority logic
- [X] Add credit expiration handling on billing cycle

**Frontend Implementation:**
- [X] Update credit balance display to show breakdown by type
- [X] Add expiration dates for subscription credits
- [X] Show which credit type is being consumed during service usage

**Testing:**
- [X] Tests for credit priority consumption, check them
- [X] Tests for credit expiration logic, check them
- [X] Integration tests for mixed credit scenarios, check them

**Notes**:
- We don't need backward compatibility for credit types.
- We don't need django migrations, we could replace previous tables.

**Validation**: User with both credit types sees subscription credits consumed first
