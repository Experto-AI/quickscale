### Sprint 26: Simplified Sync-Back Implementation (v0.37.0)

**Goal**: Implement minimal viable sync-back functionality following KISS principles

**Planning Principles Applied:**
- **KISS**: Simple two-mode detection (development/production) instead of four modes
- **DRY**: Reuse existing CLI patterns and file operations
- **Explicit Failure**: Clear error messages for unsupported scenarios
- **Focused Implementation**: Single sprint delivering working functionality

**Core Implementation**
- ✅ **Simple Installation Detection**: Check if `.git` directory exists and templates are writable
  - ✅ Two modes only: `development` (Git clone + editable install) or `production` (pip install)
  - ✅ Simple error message for production mode with setup instructions
- ✅ **Basic CLI Command**: Add `quickscale sync-back <project-path>` with two flags
  - ✅ `--preview`: Show which files would be copied/skipped
  - ✅ `--apply`: Copy files from project back to templates
- ✅ **Simple File Processing**: Copy files that exist in both locations
  - ✅ **Safe Files (Direct Copy)**: Templates (*.html), static files (*.css, *.js, *.svg, *.png, etc.), documentation (*.md, *.txt)
  - ✅ **Careful Files (Variable Restoration)**: Settings files (settings.py, urls.py) - replace actual values with template variables
  - ✅ **Never Sync (Auto-Skip)**: Database files (*.sqlite3, *.db), migrations (*/migrations/*.py), logs (logs/*, *.log), cache (__pycache__/*, *.pyc), environment files (.env, .env.*)
  - ✅ **New Files**: Detect and include new files in safe/careful categories
  - ✅ **Deleted Files**: Detect files removed from project and offer to delete from templates

**Basic Testing**
  - ✅ Test installation mode detection
  - ✅ Test file categorization by extension and path
  - ✅ Test safe file copying (templates, static, docs)
  - ✅ Test careful file variable restoration (settings.py, urls.py)
  - ✅ Test never-sync file skipping (database, migrations, logs)
  - ✅ Test new file detection and inclusion
  - ✅ Test deleted file detection and removal
  - ✅ Test CLI command integration

**Success Criteria - Must deliver:**
- ✅ **Working Command**: `quickscale sync-back --preview` and `--apply` work reliably
- ✅ **Clear User Experience**: Helpful error for pip users, working functionality for Git users
- ✅ **Basic Safety**: Backup before applying changes, clear preview before execution
- ✅ **Essential Testing**: Core functionality tested and validated

**Validation**: 
- ✅ Developer can modify templates in generated project and sync back to QuickScale templates
- ✅ Command fails gracefully for pip-installed users with clear guidance
- ✅ Basic functionality works on Linux (primary development platform)
