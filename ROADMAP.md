## System Architecture Overview

The QuickScale credit system supports multiple payment models and credit types with flexible billing options. For complete details about the credit system architecture, consumption logic, and technical implementation, see the [Credit System Documentation](docs/CREDIT_SYSTEM.md).

**Key Features:**
- **Two Credit Types**: Pay-as-you-go (never expire) and subscription credits (monthly expiration)
- **Three Purchase Options**: Basic plan, Pro plan, and one-time credit purchases
- **Smart Consumption**: Subscription credits consumed first, then pay-as-you-go credits
- **Variable Costs**: Each service/product consumes configurable credit amounts
- **Real-time Tracking**: Complete usage and payment history for users and admins

## Development Sprints

**Philosophy**: Small, focused sprints that can be completed in 1-2 days. Each sprint delivers immediate value and can be verified independently. Customer-facing features first, admin tools second.
