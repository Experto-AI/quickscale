# Contributing Guidelines

This document outlines the coding standards and guidelines for contributing to this project.
This document is written for humans but also for AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and Windsurf.

## Programming Stages

This project uses a 4-stage programming approach, with each stage having specific guidelines and focus areas:

### [1. PLAN.md](docs/contrib/PLAN.md) - Planning and Analysis Stage
**Purpose:** Interpret user intent, understand the project and codebase, and plan implementation steps (without making code changes yet).

**Key Focus Areas:**
- Role definition and expertise areas
- Understanding project documentation and architecture
- Applying KISS principle during planning
- Planning with SOLID principles in mind
- Task analysis and boundary definition
- Planning for architecture compliance and testability

**When to use:** Before starting any implementation, to ensure proper understanding and planning.

### [2. ACT.md](docs/contrib/ACT.md) - Implementation Stage
**Purpose:** Execute planned changes with proper coding practices.

**Key Focus Areas:**
- Applying SOLID principles during implementation
- Using DRY, KISS, and explicit failure principles
- Code structure and organization
- Code style and consistency
- Documentation during implementation
- Architecture compliance
- Focus and scope management

**When to use:** During actual code implementation, following the planned approach.

### [3. QUALITY.md](docs/contrib/QUALITY.md) - Quality Control Stage
**Purpose:** Ensure changes comply with project standards and quality requirements.

**Key Focus Areas:**
- Verifying adherence to technical stack and architecture
- Code quality validation (SOLID, DRY, KISS, explicit failure)
- Testing quality assurance
- Documentation quality assurance
- Code style quality assurance
- Focus and scope validation

**When to use:** After implementation to verify quality and compliance with standards.

### [4. DEBUG.md](docs/contrib/DEBUG.md) - Debugging and Problem Resolution Stage
**Purpose:** Help debug code that doesn't work, tested by user or tests.

**Key Focus Areas:**
- Systematic debugging approach with root cause analysis
- DMAIC process for structured debugging
- Systematic debugging with logging and tools
- Bug fixing methodology
- Focused debugging approach

**When to use:** When code doesn't work as expected or tests fail.

## Shared Guidelines

The following shared guidelines apply across all programming stages:

### [Code Principles](docs/contrib/shared/code_principles.md)
Fundamental code principles including SOLID, DRY, KISS, explicit failure, and abstraction/optimization balance. Each principle includes guidance for how it applies to different stages of development.

### [Documentation Standards](docs/contrib/shared/documentation_standards.md)
Documentation guidelines including reference sources, code documentation standards, and how documentation applies to each stage.

### [Architecture Guidelines](docs/contrib/shared/architecture_guidelines.md)
Technical stack requirements and architectural patterns that must be followed across all stages.

### [Testing Standards](docs/contrib/shared/testing_standards.md)
Testing guidelines including implementation-first approach, test structure, behavior-focused testing, and coverage requirements.

### [Task Focus Guidelines](docs/contrib/shared/task_focus_guidelines.md)
Guidelines for maintaining focus on specific tasks and avoiding scope creep.

### [Development Workflow](docs/contrib/shared/development_workflow.md)
Guidelines for feature development and bug fixing workflows.

## How to Use This Structure

### For New Features:
1. **PLAN Stage**: Attach `CONTRIBUTING.md` + `PLAN.md` only
2. **ACT Stage**: Attach `CONTRIBUTING.md` + `ACT.md` only  
3. **QUALITY Stage**: Attach `CONTRIBUTING.md` + `QUALITY.md` only
4. **DEBUG Stage**: Attach `CONTRIBUTING.md` + `DEBUG.md` only (if needed)

### For Bug Fixes:
1. **DEBUG Stage**: Attach `CONTRIBUTING.md` + `DEBUG.md` only
2. **QUALITY Stage**: Attach `CONTRIBUTING.md` + `QUALITY.md` only
3. **ACT Stage**: Attach `CONTRIBUTING.md` + `ACT.md` only (if additional implementation needed)

### For Code Reviews:
1. **QUALITY Stage**: Attach `CONTRIBUTING.md` + `QUALITY.md` only

**ðŸ“‹ Note:** Each stage file contains embedded references to all necessary shared guidelines. You only need to attach 2 files per stage!
