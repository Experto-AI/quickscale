# QuickScale Documentation Consistency Analysis

**Scope**: Strategic inconsistencies across DECISIONS, README, ROADMAP, COMPETITIVE_ANALYSIS, SCAFFOLDING, COMMERCIAL, QUICKSCALE
**Focus**: Decision/competitive level concepts (ignoring trivial inconsistencies)

---

## Executive Summary

This analysis identifies **6 strategic inconsistencies** across QuickScale documentation that affect MVP scope, implementation priorities, and timeline clarity. The issues range from critical (production-ready feature scope confusion) to moderate (CLI helper timeline ambiguity).

**Key Findings**:
- âœ… **Good**: Core architectural decisions are consistent (git subtree, settings inheritance, backend_extensions)
- ðŸ”´ **Critical**: Production-ready features marked both "IN MVP" and "Post-MVP" in different docs
- âœ… **Resolved**: Dependency management strategy chosen â€” Poetry-only with documented export for pip-only workflows
- ðŸŸ¢ **Minor**: Timeline references use both "v1.x" and "v2.x" inconsistently

**Recommendation**: Resolve critical issues before starting implementation to avoid building the wrong thing.

## Critical Issues (Strategic Decision Required)

---



## Important Issues (Affect Implementation)

## Minor Issues (Documentation Clarity)

### ðŸŸ¢ ISSUE #6: Settings Inheritance Examples Placement

**Severity**: MINOR - Doesn't affect decisions, just reader clarity

#### Observation

**SCAFFOLDING.md (lines 356-374)** shows both standalone and inheritance settings examples.

The inheritance example is labeled "Post-MVP Settings (Inheritance - Illustrative Only)" but could be clearer about:
1. When users would actually implement this
2. That it requires manual embedding of quickscale_core first
3. Link to the authoritative policy in DECISIONS.md

#### Recommended Actions

1. **SCAFFOLDING.md:377**: Add cross-reference: "See [DECISIONS.md Settings Inheritance Policy](./DECISIONS.md#mvp-feature-matrix-authoritative) for authoritative guidance"
2. **Add prerequisites**: "Note: Inheritance requires manual quickscale_core embedding via git subtree (advanced users only)"

---

### ðŸŸ¢ ISSUE #7: backend_extensions.py Example Location

**Severity**: MINOR - Affects user convenience

#### Observation

**README.md (lines 262-267)** says:
> "If you'd like a single, discoverable place to wire project-specific backend customizations, copy the example in `examples/client_extensions/`"

But the repository structure doesn't currently have this example file.

#### Recommended Actions

1. **Create**: `examples/client_extensions/README.md` with backend_extensions.py example
2. **Include**: Minimal AppConfig.ready() wiring example
3. **Cross-reference**: Link to [DECISIONS.md Backend Extensions Policy](./DECISIONS.md#backend-extensions-policy)

## Proposed Safe Edits (No Architecture Changes)

These can be implemented immediately without strategic decisions:

### COMPETITIVE_ANALYSIS.md
1. **Line 58**: Change Docker Support from "Post-MVP" to "IN (v0.53)"
2. **Add table**: Competitive milestone progression (Production/Feature/Ecosystem parity)

### ROADMAP.md
1. **Add clarification** after line 72: "Note: v0.52-v1.0 collectively represent the MVP (Production-Ready Personal Toolkit). Earlier releases (v0.52-v0.55) are foundation increments."
2. **Line 1187**: Change "Competitive Parity" to "SaaS Feature Parity (auth, billing, teams)"
3. **Line 1175**: Update CLI helpers to "v1.5 (conditional) or v2.0"

### DECISIONS.md
1. **Add after line 78**: "**MVP Definition**: The MVP comprises all releases from v0.52 through v1.0.0, cumulatively delivering a production-ready personal toolkit. Individual releases (v0.52, v0.53, etc.) are incremental foundations."
2. **Line 246-255**: Update CLI command timeline to "v1.5/v2.0 (conditional)"

### README.md
1. **Line 140**: Either remove `requirements-dev.txt` OR clarify: "_(Not generated; run `poetry export` if needed)_"

### SCAFFOLDING.md
1. **Line 377**: Add cross-reference to DECISIONS.md settings policy
2. **Line 390**: Add note about prerequisites for settings inheritance

### New File: examples/client_extensions/
1. **Create**: `examples/client_extensions/README.md`
2. **Create**: `examples/client_extensions/backend_extensions.py`
3. **Include**: AppConfig.ready() wiring example
