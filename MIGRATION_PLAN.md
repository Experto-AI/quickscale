## Project Migration Completion âœ…

As of May 2025, the QuickScale migration from the legacy `build` command to the new `init`-based workflow has been successfully completed. All planned tasks have been implemented, tested, and verified in production environments.

### Key Accomplishments:

- Full transition to environment variable-based configuration
- Enhanced security with validation of all critical settings
- Comprehensive test suite covering unit, integration, and E2E scenarios
- Complete documentation including template customization guides
- Seamless backwards compatibility for existing projects
- Cross-platform compatibility verified on Linux, macOS, and Windows

The migration has resulted in a more robust, secure, and user-friendly QuickScale tool that maintains the simplicity of the original while adding significant improvements in configuration, validation, and error handling.

Users can now reliably create new projects with the `quickscale init` command and enjoy a standardized development experience across all supported platforms.
