## QuickScale: Compose your Django SaaS.

QuickScale is a **composable Django framework** for building client SaaS applications. Start with a stable core, add reusable modules, customize themes, and deploy faster—while maintaining the flexibility to create commercial extensions and build a community ecosystem.

---

## What is QuickScale?

QuickScale is a **composable Django framework** designed for **solo developers and development agencies** who build multiple client SaaS applications. It provides a stable foundation with reusable components, enabling you to:

- **Build once, reuse everywhere**: Create modules and themes that work across all your client projects
- **Maintain commercial flexibility**: Keep core components open source while offering premium modules/themes via subscriptions
- **Scale your development business**: Standardize your tech stack and accelerate client project delivery
- **Build a community ecosystem**: Share and monetize your extensions while benefiting from community contributions

🧭 **Evolution Snapshot**: QuickScale intentionally ships as a personal toolkit today and only grows into a community platform when real demand emerges. Catch the full story in the [evolution overview](./QUICKSCALE.md#evolution-strategy-personal-toolkit-first).

- Start with `README.md` for the big-picture overview, then dive into `DECISIONS.md` whenever you need the canonical rule or tie-breaker.
- Use `ROADMAP.md` only for planning work that implements decisions already captured in `DECISIONS.md`.
- Maintainers should cross-check the [document responsibilities section in `DECISIONS.md`](./DECISIONS.md#document-responsibilities-short) to keep this map aligned.

## Glossary

Canonical terminology used across QuickScale documentation:

- **MVP** = Minimum Viable Product = Phase 1 = Personal Toolkit approach
- **Post-MVP** = Phase 2+ (prefer explicit phase numbers when possible)
- **Phase 1** = MVP (Personal Toolkit)
- **Phase 2** = Module extraction (v1.1-v1.x)
- **Phase 3** = Professional polish (v1.x)
- **Phase 4** = Community platform (v2.0+)
- **Module** = Backend module (Django app under `quickscale_modules`)
- **Theme** = Starting point Django app under `quickscale_themes`
- **Generated Project** = Output of `quickscale init`

**Usage**: Prefer "MVP" or "Phase 1" over "Personal Toolkit" in technical docs. Use "Personal Toolkit" in strategic/marketing contexts.

## SSOT (Single Source of Truth) Reference

This table shows which document to consult for authoritative decisions on common topics.

| Topic | Single Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| MVP Scope & Feature Matrix | `DECISIONS.md` | Canonical IN/OUT matrix for MVP
| Git Subtree Workflow | `DECISIONS.md#integration-note-personal-toolkit-git-subtree` | Full commands and guidance
| Directory Layouts / Scaffolding | `SCAFFOLDING.md` | Full tree diagrams and templates
| Strategic Rationale / Evolution | `QUICKSCALE.md` | Long-form narrative and market context
| Commercial Models & Licensing | `COMMERCIAL.md` | Post-MVP monetization guidance


### Primary Use Cases:
- **Solo Developer**: Build client projects faster with reusable components you maintain
- **Development Agency**: Standardize your tech stack across multiple client engagements  
- **Commercial Extension Developer**: Create and sell premium modules/themes
- **Open Source Contributor**: Extend the ecosystem with new modules and themes

### Development Flow (MVP)
1. `quickscale init myapp`
  - Generates the minimal Django starter described in the MVP Feature Matrix
  - Ships with standalone `settings.py` by default; there is NO automatic settings inheritance. Advanced users who manually embed `quickscale_core` via git subtree may opt-in to inherit from `quickscale_core.settings` (see [`DECISIONS.md`](./DECISIONS.md#mvp-feature-matrix-authoritative)).
  - **Optional**: Embed `quickscale_core` via git subtree after generation; follow the [Personal Toolkit workflow](./DECISIONS.md#integration-note-personal-toolkit-git-subtree) for canonical commands and helper roadmap
2. Add your custom Django apps and features
3. Adopt optional inheritance or module extraction patterns only when you embed the core; the rules and best practices stay centralized in `DECISIONS.md`
4. Build your unique client application
5. Deploy using standard Django deployment patterns

ℹ️ QuickScale's MVP centers on the personal toolkit workflow. Extraction patterns, module packaging, and subtree helper command plans stay documented in `DECISIONS.md` so this README can stay concise.

🔎 **Scope note**: The [MVP Feature Matrix](./DECISIONS.md#mvp-feature-matrix-authoritative) is the single source of truth for what's in or out.

# quickscale/ (embeddable via manual subtree)
# Commands live in DECISIONS.md; CLI helpers sit in the Post-MVP backlog.
└── quickscale/
    └── quickscale_core/

⚠️ Note: The generated starter does NOT include `quickscale_modules/`. Extracting reusable apps into `quickscale_modules/` is an advanced, manual workflow for maintainers and personal monorepos — see `DECISIONS.md#module-extraction-workflow` for guidance.
```

 **Key Point**: The generated project is **production-ready** and **yours to own and modify**. QuickScale provides professional foundations (Docker, PostgreSQL, pytest, CI/CD) matching industry standards, while maintaining full customizability. For tie-breakers about MVP scope, see [DECISIONS.md MVP Feature Matrix](./DECISIONS.md#mvp-feature-matrix-authoritative).

**🎯 Competitive Positioning**: QuickScale generates projects that match SaaS Pegasus and Cookiecutter on production-readiness while offering unique composability advantages. See [COMPETITIVE_ANALYSIS.md](./COMPETITIVE_ANALYSIS.md) for detailed comparison.

## Key Benefits

**Production-Ready Foundations** (Match competitors on quality):
- **Docker & PostgreSQL**: Production-ready containerization and database setup from day one
- **Security Best Practices**: Environment-based config, secure defaults, proper middleware configuration
- **Testing Infrastructure**: pytest + factory_boy with CI/CD via GitHub Actions
- **Professional Tooling**: Pre-commit hooks (black, ruff, isort) for code quality

**Unique QuickScale Advantages** (Beat competitors on architecture):
- **Shared Updates**: Get security fixes and improvements across all client projects via git subtree
- **Composable Modules**: Reuse authentication, billing, teams across projects (Post-MVP)
- **Agency-Optimized**: Build multiple client SaaS apps with consistent, reusable foundations
- **Full Ownership**: Generated projects are yours to modify with no vendor lock-in

**Django Ecosystem** (Built on proven foundations):
- **Battle-Tested Packages**: django-allauth (auth), dj-stripe (payments), django-anymail (email)
- **Standard Patterns**: No magic, no custom abstractions—just excellent Django
- **Simple Deployment**: Standard Django deployment patterns, cloud-agnostic

See [COMPETITIVE_ANALYSIS.md](./COMPETITIVE_ANALYSIS.md) for detailed comparison with SaaS Pegasus, Cookiecutter, and alternatives.

## QuickScale Philosophy: Enabler, Not Complete Solutions

QuickScale provides the foundation and building blocks, not complete vertical solutions:

✅ **What QuickScale IS:**
- Foundation for building custom SaaS applications
- Modules built on proven Django foundations (dj-stripe, django-allauth, etc.)
- Starting point themes you must extend (models, business logic, UX)
- Development accelerator, not an end product

❌ **What QuickScale is NOT:**
- Complete e-commerce / CRM / real estate platform
- Ready-to-use vertical SaaS
- One-size-fits-all template pack
- Runtime plugin loader (no WordPress-style activation)

## From Template to Client Project

Start with the generated Django starter, build what your client needs, and only later decide if a pattern is worth extracting into `quickscale_modules/`. Distribution upgrades (PyPI, subscriptions, etc.) stay Post-MVP—follow the [MVP Feature Matrix](./DECISIONS.md#mvp-feature-matrix-authoritative) and [`QUICKSCALE.md`](./QUICKSCALE.md#evolution-strategy-personal-toolkit-first) for the bigger story.

---

 ### Development Approach (MVP)

QuickScale currently ships a single CLI entry point: `quickscale init`. The [CLI command matrix](./DECISIONS.md#cli-command-matrix) tracks the **planned** additions and their phases, keeping this README focused on commands that already exist.

### **Post-MVP: Configuration-Driven (Optional)**
Declarative configuration is a Post-MVP consideration. Prototype commands, sample schemas, and status notes now live exclusively in `DECISIONS.md`.

### Settings Pattern (Post-MVP)

Generated projects use standalone `settings.py` files by default. Optional inheritance and future settings plans are recorded in `DECISIONS.md` alongside the authoritative MVP feature matrix.

---

## CLI Reference (MVP)

### **QuickScale CLI - Simple and Minimal**

#### **Project Creation**

```bash
quickscale init <project_name>
```

**That's it.** No flags, no options, no complexity.

**What It Does:**
1. Creates Django project structure
2. Generates minimal starter application  
3. Optionally embeds `quickscale_core` utilities via git subtree
4. Ready to code in 30 seconds

**Example:**
```bash
quickscale init myapp
cd myapp
python manage.py runserver
# Visit http://localhost:8000 - see your minimal starter!
```

#### **Update Commands (Post-MVP Backlog)**

ℹ️ Wrapper helpers are deferred to the Post-MVP backlog. Track any future work in the [CLI command matrix](./DECISIONS.md#cli-command-matrix); until they ship, rely on the manual commands documented in [`DECISIONS.md`](./DECISIONS.md#integration-note-personal-toolkit-git-subtree).

## Glossary

Canonical terminology used across QuickScale documentation:

- MVP = Phase 1 (minimal personal toolkit)
- Post-MVP = Phase 2+ (features planned after MVP; prefer explicit phase numbers)
- Module = Backend module (Django app under `quickscale_modules`)
- Theme = Starting point Django app under `quickscale_themes`
- Generated Project = Output of `quickscale init`

Add new terms here as documentation evolves; this section consolidates terminology so other docs can link here as the canonical source.

For optional backend customization patterns, reference the [backend extensions policy](./DECISIONS.md#backend-extensions-policy).


## Optional backend customization (opt-in example)

The MVP does NOT auto-generate a `backend_extensions.py` file. If you'd like a single, discoverable place to wire project-specific backend customizations, copy the example in `examples/client_extensions/` into your generated project and optionally enable it by adding `client_extensions` to `INSTALLED_APPS`.

The example shows a minimal `backend_extensions.register()` contract and `AppConfig.ready()` wiring so you can opt in to a single extension entry point without changing the generator's minimal output.
