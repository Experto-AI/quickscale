# DEBUG - Debugging and Problem Resolution Stage

This document guides the debugging and problem resolution stage of programming, where you help debug code that doesn't work, tested by user or tests.

**ðŸ“‹ Usage Note:** This file contains complete debugging guidance with embedded references to shared principles. You only need to attach `docs/contrib/contributing.md` and `debug.md` - all shared guidelines are referenced within this document.

## Systematic Debugging Approach

### Apply Root Cause Analysis

#### Systematically Investigate to Identify and Fix the Fundamental Root Cause of Issues
- Always pursue the fundamental source of the problem
- Never implement workarounds or fallbacks that mask the underlying issue
- Use systematic approaches to identify causes rather than addressing symptoms

**Example of Proper Root Cause Analysis:**
```python
# Bug: User permissions occasionally fail to update

# Root cause investigation:
# 1. Reproduce the issue consistently
# 2. Analyze logs around the time of failure
# 3. Trace data flow from permission changes
# 4. Identify race condition in permission cache updates

# Fix the actual cause (race condition)
def update_user_permissions(user_id, permissions):
    """Update user permissions with proper locking."""
    with permission_lock:  # Add proper locking mechanism
        user = get_user(user_id)
        user.permissions = permissions
        db.save(user)
        cache.update(f"user_perms:{user_id}", permissions)  # Cache update within lock
```

**Example of Superficial Fix (Avoid):**
```python
# Bug: User permissions occasionally fail to update

# Workaround that doesn't address the root cause
def update_user_permissions(user_id, permissions):
    """Update user permissions with ineffective workaround."""
    user = get_user(user_id)
    user.permissions = permissions
    db.save(user)
    
    # Workaround: Deleting cache instead of fixing race condition
    cache.delete(f"user_perms:{user_id}")
    
    # Workaround: Adding retry logic that doesn't fix underlying issue
    for _ in range(3):
        try:
            cache.update(f"user_perms:{user_id}", permissions)
            break
        except:
            time.sleep(0.1)
```



#### Test Failures After Codebase Changes

When a test fails after codebase changes:
  - Always perform root cause analysis to determine if the test or the code is at fault
  - If the test is outdated and should be updated to match intentional changes in requirements, update the test
  - If the test is still valid and the code change introduced a regression, fix the code
  - Never update a test just to make it passâ€”always confirm whether the test or the code is correct according to current requirements
  - Always document your reasoning and the root cause for updating either the test or the code

**Actionable Steps:**
  - Investigate the failure:
    - Read the test and understand what behavior it checks
    - Review recent code changes that may have affected this behavior
  - Determine intent:
    - Clarify whether the tested behavior is still required by current project requirements
    - If requirements changed, confirm with documentation, changelogs, or stakeholders
  - Decide what to fix:
    - If the test reflects current, intended behavior, fix the code to restore the expected outcome
    - If the test is outdated due to intentional changes, update the test to match new requirements
  - Document your reasoning:
    - Clearly document why you updated the test or the code, referencing requirements or root cause analysis
    - Add comments or commit messages explaining the decision
  - Add regression tests:
    - If a regression was found, add or update tests to prevent recurrence
  - Verify thoroughly:
    - Run the full test suite to ensure all related functionality works as intended

**Example Decision Table:**

| Situation                                 | Action                |
|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Test is valid, code is wrong (regression)  | Fix the code          |
| Test is outdated, code is correct          | Update the test       |
| Unclear (ambiguous requirements)           | Investigate, clarify, document decision |

## DMAIC Process for Structured Debugging

### Define: Clearly Define the Problem with Specific Symptoms and Success Criteria

```python
# Define phase documentation
"""
Bug: Authentication fails for users with non-ASCII characters in usernames
Reproduction: 100% of login attempts fail when username contains Ã©, Ã¼, etc.
Expected: All valid usernames should authenticate regardless of character set
Impact: ~5% of international users cannot log in
Success criteria: All users with valid credentials can log in
"""
```

### Measure: Gather Quantitative Data and Create Reproducible Test Cases
```python
# Measure phase - create a test case
def test_authentication_with_unicode_characters():
    """Test authentication with non-ASCII characters in username."""
    # Test data
    test_users = [
        {"username": "jÃ¶hn", "password": "secure123", "should_pass": True},
        {"username": "marÃ­a", "password": "secure123", "should_pass": True},
        {"username": "andrÃ©", "password": "secure123", "should_pass": True}
    ]
    
    # Measure results
    results = []
    for user in test_users:
        result = authenticate(user["username"], user["password"])
        results.append({
            "username": user["username"],
            "expected": user["should_pass"],
            "actual": result,
            "passed": result == user["should_pass"]
        })
        
    # Log measurements
    logger.info(f"Authentication test results: {results}")
    return results
```

### Analyze: Systematically Analyze Data to Identify the Precise Root Cause
```python
# Analyze phase - identified root cause
"""
Root cause analysis:

1. Traced authentication flow through all components
2. Found username is properly UTF-8 encoded in the request
3. Database query correctly uses parameterized queries
4. Found that username is being incorrectly encoded in the query builder:
   - Line 142: username.encode('ascii', 'ignore') is stripping non-ASCII chars
   - This causes query to look for incomplete username

Conclusion: Incorrect encoding in query builder is the root cause
"""
```

### Improve: Implement a Solution Addressing the Root Cause and Validate It
```python
# Improve phase - implementing the fix

# Before (problematic code):
def build_auth_query(username, password_hash):
    # Incorrect: Strips non-ASCII characters
    ascii_username = username.encode('ascii', 'ignore').decode('ascii')
    return f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '{ascii_username}'"

# After (fixed code):
def build_auth_query(username, password_hash):
    # Fixed: Using proper parameterized queries with UTF-8 support
    return "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = %s", [username]
```

### Control: Prevent Regression with Tests, Monitoring, and Documentation Updates
```python
# Control phase - preventing regression

# 1. Add regression test
def test_unicode_username_authentication():
    """Ensure users with Unicode characters can authenticate."""
    result = authenticate("jÃ¶hn", "correct_password")
    assert result is True

# 2. Add validation to prevent similar issues
def validate_query_params(params):
    """Validate that query params are properly handled for all character sets."""
    for param in params:
        if isinstance(param, str):
            # Test encoding/decoding to ensure no data loss
            encoded = param.encode('utf-8')
            decoded = encoded.decode('utf-8')
            assert param == decoded, f"Encoding validation failed for: {param}"

# 3. Update documentation
"""
Updated authentication documentation to specify UTF-8 support
Added section on proper parameter handling in queries
"""
```

## Systematic Debugging with Logging and Tools

### Utilize Structured Logging and Debugging Tools for Systematic Problem Investigation

### Test Output Analysis for Debugging

When debugging test failures, use specialized output modes to focus on actual issues:

```bash
# Show only failed tests (filter out noise from passing tests)
./run_tests.sh --failures-only --unit

# Stop immediately at first failure (for focused debugging)
./run_tests.sh --exitfirst --unit
```

**Why use these modes for debugging:**
- **Eliminates noise**: Hundreds of passing tests contaminate the analysis context
- **Focuses attention**: Only shows actual failures that need investigation
- **Clean format**: Minimal output optimized for systematic analysis
- **Immediate feedback**: Stop-on-first-failure prevents cascading failure noise
- **Root cause clarity**: Clean output makes it easier to identify underlying issues

**When debugging test failures, avoid standard verbose output** which includes irrelevant passing test information that obscures the actual problems requiring attention and contaminates the debugging context.

```python
# Systematic debugging approach

# 1. Add detailed logging around the issue
def process_transaction(transaction_id):
    """Process a financial transaction."""
    logger.info(f"Starting transaction {transaction_id}")
    
    try:
        transaction = get_transaction(transaction_id)
        logger.debug(f"Transaction data: {transaction}")
        
        # Processing steps with logging
        result = payment_gateway.process(transaction)
        logger.info(f"Gateway response: {result}")
        
        if not result.success:
            logger.error(f"Transaction failed: {result.error_code} - {result.message}")
            # Analyze error patterns, don't just retry blindly
            
        return result
    except Exception as e:
        logger.exception(f"Exception in transaction {transaction_id}")
        raise  # Don't suppress the exception - let it propagate for proper handling
```

### Avoid Ad-Hoc Debugging
```python
# Poor debugging approach

def process_transaction(transaction_id):
    """Process a financial transaction."""
    # No logging of inputs or context
    
    try:
        transaction = get_transaction(transaction_id)
        result = payment_gateway.process(transaction)
        
        # Superficial error handling with no debugging info
        if not result.success:
            print(f"Error: {result}")  # Temporary print statement
            return retry_transaction(transaction_id)  # Retry without understanding why
            
        return result
    except:
        # Swallow exception without logging details
        print("Something went wrong")
        return {"success": False}  # Return arbitrary result
```

## Bug Fixing Methodology

### Understand the Root Cause
Reference: [Development Workflow - Bug Fixing](shared/development_workflow.md#bug-fixing)

#### Implement Proper Transaction Handling and Validation to Fix Concurrency Issues
```python
# A proper bug fix addressing the root cause

# Bug: User balance becomes negative when multiple concurrent withdrawals occur

# Fix: Add proper transaction handling and validation
def withdraw(user_id, amount):
    """Withdraw money from user account with proper validation."""
    with db.transaction():  # Ensure atomic operation
        user = db.get_user(user_id, for_update=True)  # Lock row
        
        if user.balance < amount:
            return OperationResult(success=False, error="Insufficient funds")
            
        user.balance -= amount
        db.update_user(user)
        
    return OperationResult(success=True)
```

#### Never Implement Superficial Fixes That Mask Underlying Problems
```python
# Superficial fix that doesn't address the root cause

# Bug: User balance becomes negative

# Bad fix: Just prevent negative values without addressing concurrency
def withdraw(user_id, amount):
    user = db.get_user(user_id)  # No locking
    
    # Just prevents negative values but doesn't fix race condition
    new_balance = max(0, user.balance - amount)
    user.balance = new_balance
    db.update_user(user)
    
    # Masks the problem instead of fixing it
```

### Minimize Code Changes
- Keep fixes focused and minimal
- Don't refactor unrelated code during bug fixes

```python
# Original buggy code
def calculate_discount(price, discount_percent):
    # Bug: Doesn't handle negative discount_percent
    discount = price * discount_percent / 100
    return price - discount

# Focused fix
def calculate_discount(price, discount_percent):
    # Fix: Ensure discount_percent is non-negative
    discount_percent = max(0, discount_percent)
    discount = price * discount_percent / 100
    return price - discount
```

### Add Regression Tests
```python
# Bug: calculate_discount() fails with negative discount_percent

def test_calculate_discount_with_negative_percent():
    """Test that negative discount percentages are handled correctly."""
    # Arrange
    price = 100
    negative_discount = -20
    
    # Act
    result = calculate_discount(price, negative_discount)
    
    # Assert
    assert result == 100  # No discount should be applied
    
def test_calculate_discount_with_valid_percent():
    """Test that valid discount percentages work correctly."""
    # Arrange
    price = 100
    discount = 20
    
    # Act
    result = calculate_discount(price, discount)
    
    # Assert
    assert result == 80  # 20% discount should be applied
```

### Document the Fix
```python
def calculate_discount(price, discount_percent):
    """Calculate the discounted price with proper handling of negative values."""
    # Fix for BUG-1234: Handle negative discount percentages
    # Using max() to ensure discount_percent is never negative
    discount_percent = max(0, discount_percent)
    discount = price * discount_percent / 100
    return price - discount
```

## Focused Debugging Approach

### Fix Only the Specific Reported Bug Without Additional Changes
- Address only the exact bug described without fixing adjacent issues
- Resist adding enhancements or fixing unreported issues when fixing bugs
- Verify your fix addresses precisely the reported issue and nothing more

```python
# Bug report: Function crashes when input is None

# Original function with bug
def process_data(data):
    """Process the input data."""
    result = data.strip().lower()  # Crashes if data is None
    return result

# Targeted fix
def process_data(data):
    """Process the input data."""
    if data is None:
        return None
    result = data.strip().lower()
    return result
```

### Avoid Over-Engineering Fixes
```python
# Bug report: Function crashes when input is None

# Overengineered fix with unrelated changes
def process_data(data, normalize=True, validate=True):
    """Process the input data with enhanced features."""
    # Fixed the reported bug
    if data is None:
        return None
        
    # Unrequested validation feature
    if validate and not isinstance(data, str):
        raise TypeError("Input must be a string")
        
    # Unrequested normalization options
    result = data.strip()
    if normalize:
        result = result.lower()
        result = re.sub(r'\s+', ' ', result)
        result = unicodedata.normalize('NFKC', result)
        
    # Added unrequested caching
    cache.set(f"processed:{hash(data)}", result, timeout=3600)
    
    return result
```
