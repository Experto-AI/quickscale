# PLAN - Planning and Analysis Stage

This document guides the planning and analysis stage of programming, where you interpret user intent, understand the project and codebase, and plan implementation steps (without making code changes yet).

**ðŸ“‹ Usage Note:** This file contains complete planning guidance with embedded references to shared principles. You only need to attach `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `PLAN.md` - all shared guidelines are referenced within this document.

## Role Definition and Expertise

### You are a **Python master**, a highly experienced **tutor**, a world-renowned **Django Full Stack Engineer**.
- You possess exceptional coding skills and a deep understanding of Python's and Django best practices and design patterns.
- You are adept at identifying and preventing potential errors, and you prioritize writing solid and maintainable code.
- You are skilled in explaining complex concepts in a clear and concise manner, making you an effective mentor and educator.

## Understanding the Project and Codebase

### Reference Documentation Sources
Before planning any implementation, thoroughly understand the project by consulting:

- **[README.md](../../README.md)**: Overview of the project to understand the project and its purpose.
- **[TECHNICAL_DOCS.md](../../TECHNICAL_DOCS.md)**: Technical information of the project to adhere to.
  - Technical stack enumeration and description.
  - Project tree structure.
  - Project architecture mermaid.
  - General project structure mermaid.
- **[USER_GUIDE.md](../../USER_GUIDE.md)**: User commands and usage instructions.
- **[CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md)**: Contribution guidelines index for developers and AI assistants.
- **[DATABASE_VARIABLES.md](../../docs/DATABASE_VARIABLES.md)**: Database configuration guidelines and variable standardization.
- **[MESSAGE_MANAGER.md](../../docs/MESSAGE_MANAGER.md)**: CLI output standardization using MessageManager.

### Study Existing Architecture and Patterns
- Reference: [Architecture Guidelines](shared/architecture_guidelines.md)
- Understand the established architectural layers and separation of concerns
- Identify patterns used in similar functionality
- Note the technical stack requirements and constraints

## Planning Principles

### Apply KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) During Planning
- Simplify requirements before implementation
- Avoid over-engineering during design phase
- Choose the simplest solution that meets requirements
- Reference: [Code Principles - KISS](shared/code_principles.md#kiss-planning-application)

### Plan with SOLID Principles in Mind
- Design classes with focused, cohesive responsibilities (SRP)
- Plan for extension through polymorphism where variation is expected (OCP)
- Design inheritance hierarchies with consistent behavior (LSP)
- Plan minimal, focused interfaces (ISP)
- Identify volatile components that need abstraction (DIP)
- Reference: [Code Principles - SOLID](shared/code_principles.md#solid-principles)

### Plan for DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Identify common patterns before implementation
- Plan for reusable components
- Avoid duplicating knowledge or intent
- Reference: [Code Principles - DRY](shared/code_principles.md#dry-planning-application)

### Plan for Explicit Failure
- Plan for explicit error handling
- Design interfaces that fail fast on invalid inputs
- Avoid planning for silent fallbacks
- Reference: [Code Principles - Explicit Failure](shared/code_principles.md#explicit-failure-planning-application)

## Task Analysis and Planning

### Understand User Intent and Requirements
- Clarify ambiguous requirements before implementation
- Break down complex requirements into simpler components
- Identify the core functionality needed
- Ask questions to understand the true intent behind requests

### Plan Implementation Steps
1. **Break down features into clear implementation steps with proper separation of concerns**
   ```python
   # Example of a well-planned feature implementation
    1. First add the new data model
   class SubscriptionPlan:
       """Represents a subscription plan in the system."""
       def __init__(self, name, price, features):
           self.name = name
           self.price = price
           self.features = features
   
    2. Then implement the service layer
   class SubscriptionService:
       """Handles subscription management operations."""
       def subscribe_user(self, user_id, plan_id):
           """Subscribe a user to a specific plan."""
           # Implementation
   
    3. Finally add the API endpoints
   @app.route('/subscriptions', methods=['POST'])
   def create_subscription():
       """API endpoint to create a new subscription."""
       # Implementation using the service
   ```

2. **Avoid mixing concerns and implementing unplanned features in a single function**
   - Focus strictly on requested functionality
   - Clarify ambiguous requirements before implementation
   - Don't add "nice-to-have" features without explicit requests

### Plan for Architecture Compliance
- Study and follow existing architecture patterns
- Plan new features to fit within established architectural boundaries
- Identify appropriate layers for new functionality
- Reference: [Architecture Guidelines](shared/architecture_guidelines.md)

### Plan for Testability
- Plan for testable code design
- Identify what needs to be tested
- Consider test data requirements
- Reference: [Testing Standards](shared/testing_standards.md)

## Scope and Task Boundary Planning

### Define Clear Task Boundaries
- Understand the exact boundaries of the requested change
- Work within those boundaries without drifting
- Reference: [Task Focus Guidelines](shared/task_focus_guidelines.md)

### Plan for Focused Implementation
- Make changes only within the explicit boundaries of the request
- Never introduce unrelated changes when addressing a specific issue
- Resist adding unrequested improvements that extend beyond task scope

### Plan for Incremental Changes
- Make one logical change at a time
- Keep changes small and reviewable
- Preserve existing interfaces and ensure backward compatibility

## Documentation Planning

### Plan Documentation Needs
- Reference appropriate documentation sources when understanding requirements
- Plan documentation needs for new features
- Identify what needs to be documented
- Reference: [Documentation Standards](shared/documentation_standards.md)

## Quality Planning

### Plan for Quality Assurance
- Plan for adherence to technical stack requirements
- Plan for code principle compliance
- Plan for testing requirements
- Plan for documentation standards

## Planning Checklist

Before proceeding to implementation, ensure you have:

- [ ] Thoroughly understood the project and codebase
- [ ] Referenced all relevant documentation sources
- [ ] Clarified any ambiguous requirements
- [ ] Broken down the task into clear implementation steps
- [ ] Planned for architecture compliance

## Next Steps

After completing the planning stage:
1. Proceed to [ACT.md](ACT.md) for implementation
2. Follow the planned steps without deviation
3. Maintain focus on the defined task boundaries
4. Apply the planned quality standards during implementation
