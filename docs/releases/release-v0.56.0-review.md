**Reference**: [decisions.md - Authoritative Policies](../technical/decisions.md#authoritative-policies)

---

## Code Quality Assessment

### SOLID Principles Compliance: ✅ PASS

#### Single Responsibility Principle
**Status**: ✅ Compliant
- Each template file has a single, well-defined responsibility
- `ci.yml.j2` handles only CI/CD configuration
- `conftest.py.j2` handles only test fixtures
- `test_example.py.j2` handles only example test demonstrations
- Generator modification properly extends file mappings without violating SRP

#### Open/Closed Principle
**Status**: ✅ Compliant
- `ProjectGenerator.file_mappings` list is extensible without modification
- New templates added without changing existing generator logic
- Template system allows extension through new files

#### Dependency Inversion Principle
**Status**: ✅ Compliant
- Generator depends on Jinja2 abstraction (not concrete template format)
- Test fixtures use Django abstractions (get_user_model())
- Proper dependency injection patterns observed

**Reference**: [code.md - SOLID Principles](../contrib/code.md#apply-solid-principles-during-implementation)

### DRY Principle Compliance: ✅ PASS

**No Code Duplication Detected**:
- ✅ Test fixtures properly extracted to `conftest.py.j2`
- ✅ CI/CD configuration centralized in single template
- ✅ Pre-commit hooks defined once
- ✅ No repeated patterns across templates

**Proper Abstraction**:
- ✅ Reusable fixtures (`user_data`, `create_user`, `user`, `admin_user`)
- ✅ Consistent template structure across all files
- ✅ Generator uses single rendering mechanism

**Reference**: [code.md - Apply DRY](../contrib/code.md#apply-dry-dont-repeat-yourself)

### KISS Principle Compliance: ✅ PASS

**Appropriate Simplicity**:
- ✅ Templates are straightforward and readable
- ✅ No overengineering in test fixtures
- ✅ CI/CD configuration uses standard patterns
- ✅ Generator changes are minimal and focused

**No Unnecessary Complexity**:
- ❌ No abstract factories where simple functions suffice
- ❌ No complex inheritance hierarchies
- ❌ No premature optimization

**Reference**: [code.md - Apply KISS](../contrib/code.md#apply-kiss-keep-it-simple-stupid)

### Explicit Failure Handling: ✅ PASS

**Proper Error Handling**:
- ✅ Generator has appropriate exception handling (verified in generator.py)
- ✅ Test assertions are explicit and clear
- ✅ No silent failures in templates
- ✅ Error messages are descriptive

**Reference**: [code.md - Apply Explicit Failure](../contrib/code.md#apply-explicit-failure)

## Testing Quality Assurance

### Test Contamination Prevention: ✅ PASS - CRITICAL CHECK

**Global Mocking Check**: ✅ PASS
- ❌ No `sys.modules` modifications detected
- ❌ No global state modifications
- ❌ No shared mutable data between tests
- ✅ All fixtures properly scoped

**Test Isolation Verification**: ✅ PASS
```bash
# Individual test execution
✓ All tests pass individually

# Suite execution
✓ 135 tests pass in quickscale_core
✓ 11 tests pass in quickscale_cli
✓ No test ordering dependencies
✓ No side effects between tests
```

**Reference**: [review.md - Test Contamination Prevention](../contrib/review.md#verify-test-contamination-prevention)

### Implementation-First Testing: ✅ PASS

**Chronological Verification**:
- ✅ Templates created first (implementation)
- ✅ Tests added after implementation complete
- ✅ Integration tests written last

**Test Focus**:
- ✅ Tests verify behavior, not implementation details
- ✅ Tests focus on public API contracts
- ✅ Tests remain valid if implementation changes

**Reference**: [testing_standards.md - Implementation-First](../contrib/shared/testing_standards.md#implementation-first-testing-approach)

### Test Structure and Organization: ✅ PASS

**Organization Quality**:
- ✅ Tests grouped by functionality (`TestUserModel`, `TestAuthentication`)
- ✅ Consistent naming patterns throughout
- ✅ Clear class-based organization
- ✅ Related tests properly grouped

**File Organization**:
```
tests/
├── __init__.py.j2
├── conftest.py.j2        # Fixtures
└── test_example.py.j2    # Example tests
```

**Reference**: [testing_standards.md - Test Structure](../contrib/shared/testing_standards.md#test-structure-and-organization)

### Behavior-Focused Testing: ✅ PASS

**Test Quality Examples**:
```python
# ✅ CORRECT: Tests observable behavior
def test_create_user(self, user_data):
    """Test user creation"""
    user = User.objects.create_user(**user_data)
    assert user.username == user_data["username"]
    assert user.check_password(user_data["password"])

# ✅ CORRECT: Tests public API contract
def test_user_can_login(self, client, user):
    """Test that user can log in"""
    response = client.login(username=user.username, password="testpass123")
    assert response is True
```

**No Implementation Details Tested**:
- ❌ No private method testing
- ❌ No internal state inspection
- ❌ No implementation-specific assertions

**Reference**: [testing_standards.md - Behavior-Focused](../contrib/shared/testing_standards.md#behavior-focused-testing)
