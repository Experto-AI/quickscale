# Legacy Analysis: QuickScale v0.41.0

**Purpose**: Document findings from analyzing QuickScale v0.41.0 legacy codebase to identify patterns worth preserving.

**Location**: `../quickscale-legacy/`

**Status**: DEFERRED - Focus on MVP implementation first

## Analysis Guidelines

When ready to perform legacy analysis:

1. **Inventory Legacy Artifacts**
   - Document what exists in `../quickscale-legacy/`
   - List all templates, utilities, configs, and scripts
   - Note test coverage and current compatibility status

2. **Evaluate Reusability**
   - For each artifact, assess: purpose, test coverage, compatibility, reuse risks
   - Identify Docker configs, utilities, middleware, deployment scripts worth keeping
   - Flag deprecated patterns to avoid

3. **Document Findings**
   - List specific files/patterns to migrate (with rationale)
   - List patterns to avoid (with rationale)
   - Create migration plan (which items to port, when, and how)

## Current Status

**Decision**: Defer legacy analysis until after MVP foundation is established (v0.52.0+)

**Rationale**:
- MVP focuses on new architecture, not migration
- Legacy code is preserved in `../quickscale-legacy/` for future reference
- Can extract valuable patterns as needed during development
- Avoid analysis paralysis by building forward first

## Recommended Next Steps

1. Complete MVP foundation (v0.52.0-v0.56.0)
2. Build initial project generation capability
3. Test with real client projects
4. **Then** review legacy for proven patterns worth extracting

## Placeholder Analysis

When analysis is performed, document findings here:

### Worth Extracting
- TBD (list specific files/patterns)

### Worth Avoiding
- TBD (list deprecated patterns)

### Migration Plan
- TBD (timeline and approach)

```
