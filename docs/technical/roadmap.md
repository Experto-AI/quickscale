# QuickScale Development Roadmap

> **You are here**: [QuickScale](../../START_HERE.md) → [Technical](../index.md) → **Roadmap** (Open Work Only)
> **Related docs**: [Decisions](decisions.md) | [Scaffolding](scaffolding.md) | [Changelog](../../CHANGELOG.md) | [Release Summary Template](release_summary_template.md) | [Start Here](../../START_HERE.md)

## Purpose

Tracks only pending roadmap work. Completed history is in [CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md). Each phase is sized as Adaptive Tier 1–2; split before implementing if a checklist item is Tier 3.

**Rules:**
- Keep only open todo items here.
- Move completed implementation history to CHANGELOG.md in concise form.
- Each phase links back (`why →`) to the finding that justifies it.

## Parallel Execution Tracks

Work is split across 3 git worktrees that develop in parallel and merge back to `v87` after each phase. `v87` is the clean integration branch — never commit directly to it.

### Track assignment

| Track | Worktree | Branch | Owns |
|-------|---------|--------|------|
| 1 | `quickscale-wt-track1` | `wt-track1` | M7 — F11 module isolation (F11.12b–F11.13b) |
| 2 | `quickscale-wt-track2` | `wt-track2` | M10 — F5 DR engine split (F5.2b–F5.4) |

### Cross-track dependency

Track 3 (M5/M8/M11) is complete. No remaining cross-track dependencies.

### Start procedure

Run at the beginning of every new phase, before touching any files:

```bash
cd /home/victor/code/quickscale-wt-track{N}
git status             # must be clean — commit or stash any in-progress work first
git merge v87          # pull in everything other tracks have merged since last sync
# resolve any conflicts, then continue with the phase
```

> **Why every phase:** other tracks land changes on `v87` between your phases. Starting from a stale base makes conflicts larger and harder to resolve later.

### Merge procedure

Run when a phase (or a full milestone) is complete and ready to integrate:

```bash
cd /home/victor/code/quickscale-wt-track{N}
git merge v87          # sync latest before merge-back; resolve conflicts here
# run phase verification tests
cd /home/victor/code/quickscale
git merge --no-ff wt-track{N}
```

### Merge checkpoints

| # | Track | Phases | Status | Condition |
|---|-------|--------|--------|-----------|
| M7 | 1 | F11.11–F11.13b | 🟡 | **M7 in progress.** F11.11 ✅ merged; F11.12a ✅ merged. **Next:** F11.12b (listings isolation). |
| M10 | 2 | F5.2a–F5.4 | 🟡 | M6 ✅ + M8 ✅ merged; F5.1 ✅ (see decisions.md); F5.2a ✅ (archived — see CHANGELOG.md for detail). Target: centrally owned engine for restore/orchestration/verification (F5.2b) and protocol replacement (F5.3). |

## In-Flight Milestones

### M7 — F11 Module isolation rollout (blog/forms/listings/social)
**Track:** 1 | **Worktree:** `quickscale-wt-track1`

**Status:** 🟡 In progress — F11.11 ✅, F11.12a ✅ merged to `v87`. F11.12b/F11.13a/F11.13b pending.

## Backlog

### Sequencing

Execute top-down. Earlier items are prerequisites for or de-risk later items.

| Priority | Finding | Milestone(s) | Status |
|----------|---------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | F11 — Structural multi-tenant isolation | M7 | 🟡 M7 in progress — F11.11 ✅, F11.12a ✅, F11.12b next |
| 5 | F5 — DR engine split | M10 | 🟡 F5.1 ✅, F5.2a ✅; F5.2b–F5.4 pending |

---

### Finding 11 — Enforce structural multi-tenant isolation

**Why still open:** F11.12b (listings), F11.13a (social), and F11.13b (rollout closeout) remain. Completed work through F11.12a is archived in CHANGELOG.md.

---

**F11-deferred — Stage `terminal_semantic` per-org uniqueness** _(Adaptive tier: 2)_ _(unlocked by F11.5)_

- [ ] Split `Stage.terminal_semantic` uniqueness to per-bucket partial `UniqueConstraint`s; add migration + serializer + API regression coverage.

---

**Phase F11.12b — Listings isolation** _(M7)_ _(Adaptive tier: 2)_ _(why → [Finding 11](#finding-11--enforce-structural-multi-tenant-isolation))_

**Dependencies:** M3 merged.

- [ ] Apply `TenantModel` base + `organization_id` FK + isolation policy to `listings`.
- [ ] Unskip and confirm `listings` isolation test green.

**Phase F11.13a — Social isolation** _(M7)_ _(Adaptive tier: 2)_ _(why → [Finding 11](#finding-11--enforce-structural-multi-tenant-isolation))_

**Dependencies:** F11.11 + F11.12a + F11.12b.

- [ ] Apply `TenantModel` base + `organization_id` FK + isolation policy to `social` (and any other tenant tables discovered during rollout).

**Phase F11.13b — Rollout closeout** _(M7 closeout)_ _(Adaptive tier: 1)_ _(why → [Finding 11](#finding-11--enforce-structural-multi-tenant-isolation))_

**Dependencies:** F11.13a.

- [ ] Keep `require_org_role`/`require_org_feature` as second-line defense; verify isolation fails closed for non-view paths (admin, shell, management commands, async jobs).
- [ ] Document the migration path for already-generated projects adopting structural isolation.
- [ ] Unskip all remaining module isolation tests and confirm all green.

### Finding 5 — Split the DR engine out of the embeddable backups module

**Why still open:** F5.2b–F5.4 remain. F5.1 ✅ and F5.2a ✅ are complete — see decisions.md for the boundary contract and CHANGELOG.md for completed-history detail.

**Track:** 2 | **Worktree:** `quickscale-wt-track2` | **Merges as:** M10
**Dependencies:** M6 ✅ + M8 ✅ merged.

**Phase F5.2b — Extract restore and orchestration** _(Adaptive tier: 2)_ _(why → [Finding 5](#finding-5--split-the-dr-engine-out-of-the-embeddable-backups-module))_

**Dependencies:** F5.2a.

- [ ] Extract restore/orchestration flow, verification, and rollback-pin handling into the centrally owned engine layer.

**Phase F5.3 — Slim the module and protocol** _(Adaptive tier: 2)_ _(why → [Finding 5](#finding-5--split-the-dr-engine-out-of-the-embeddable-backups-module))_

**Dependencies:** F5.2b.

- [ ] Replace the hidden CLI↔module management-command/env-var protocol with a smaller explicit internal boundary or adapter.
- [ ] Shrink the embeddable backups module to thin Django-facing surfaces only.

**Phase F5.4 — Migration docs** _(M10 closeout)_ _(Adaptive tier: 1)_ _(why → [Finding 5](#finding-5--split-the-dr-engine-out-of-the-embeddable-backups-module))_

- [ ] Document the migration and compatibility contract for existing generated projects adopting the split DR architecture.

---

## Deferred / Monitor

- [ ] **Documentation consolidation** _(Adaptive tier: 2)_ — defer until doc drift causes real onboarding failures; manifest work (F1) simplifies auto-generated module facts.
- [ ] **Broader compatibility-window widening** _(Adaptive tier: 2)_ (F7 follow-on) — monitor user-reported version conflicts before investing beyond runtime-pin decoupling.
- [ ] **Emitted-project operability & API-contract substrate** _(deferred — split into Tier 1/2 sub-items below)_ — generated modules ship with no structured logging/correlation IDs, no versioned public API, and no webhook payload boundary validation. Promote to active backlog when a second external provider lands or the first public-API consumer appears. Stripe SDK `api_version` pinning is already listed below as a one-liner.
  - [ ] _(Tier 1)_ Add structured logging and correlation-ID baseline to generated modules.
  - [ ] _(Tier 2)_ Add versioned public-API surface (`/api/vN`) to generated module `urls.py`.
  - [ ] _(Tier 2)_ Add webhook payload boundary validation baseline.

### Explicitly out of scope

Single-PR/ticket items that do not change the design:

- Orphaned `apply-recovery.yml` cleanup after a crashed final state-write.
- Pinning the Stripe SDK `api_version` as a one-liner.
- Missing `list_filter`/`select_related` in individual admin classes.
- Individual `pragma: no cover` lines.
