# QuickScale Development Roadmap

> **You are here**: [QuickScale](../../START_HERE.md) → [Technical](../index.md) → **Roadmap** (Open Work, plus recently-completed handoff)
> **Related docs**: [Decisions](decisions.md) | [Scaffolding](scaffolding.md) | [Changelog](../../CHANGELOG.md) | [Release Summary Template](release_summary_template.md) | [Start Here](../../START_HERE.md)

## Purpose

Tracks pending roadmap work and, when open items are resolved, a brief recently-completed handoff section. Detailed completed implementation history remains in [CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md). Each phase is sized as Adaptive Tier 1–2; split before implementing if a checklist item is Tier 3.

**Rules:**
- Keep open todo items here, plus optionally a recently-completed handoff section.
- Move detailed completed implementation history to CHANGELOG.md.
- Each open phase links back (`why →`) to the finding that justifies it.

## Parallel Execution Tracks

Work is split across 3 git worktrees that develop in parallel and merge back to `v87` after each phase. `v87` is the clean integration branch — never commit directly to it.

### Start procedure

Run at the beginning of every new phase, before touching any files:

```bash
cd /home/victor/code/quickscale-wt-track{N}
git status             # must be clean — commit or stash any in-progress work first
git merge v87          # pull in everything other tracks have merged since last sync
# resolve any conflicts, then continue with the phase
```

### Merge procedure

Run when a phase (or a full milestone) is complete and ready to integrate:

```bash
cd /home/victor/code/quickscale-wt-track{N}
git merge v87          # sync latest before merge-back; resolve conflicts here
# run phase verification tests
cd /home/victor/code/quickscale
git merge --no-ff wt-track{N}
```

> **Shared closeout files (`CHANGELOG.md` and `docs/technical/roadmap.md`):** Because every track touches these files, they are the most likely source of merge conflicts. The procedure above already handles this — the `git merge v87` before merge-back ensures you resolve any conflicting entries on your track branch rather than on `v87`. Do not skip or reorder that step. When resolving, keep both tracks' entries (don't overwrite another track's completed work).

## Open work

_No open items._ The Structural Autopsy Remediation (opened 2026-06-30, derived from the [2026-06-30 autopsy](../../findings.md#autopsy--2026-06-30)) is complete — all tasks across Findings 1–5 (SA1.1–SA1.5, SA2.1, SA2.2, SA3.1, SA3.2, SA4.1, SA4.2, SA5.1, SA5.2) shipped and merged to `v87`. SA1.5 (the last remaining task, generated-project CI isolation gate) closed 2026-07-02. Full implementation detail is archived in [CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md); closure rationale for each finding is in [findings.md](../../findings.md).

Next work item is not yet defined — see the maintainer for the next roadmap phase.
