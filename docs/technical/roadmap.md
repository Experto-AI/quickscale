# QuickScale Development Roadmap

> **You are here**: [QuickScale](../../START_HERE.md) → [Technical](../index.md) → **Roadmap** (Open Work Only)
> **Related docs**: [Decisions](decisions.md) | [Scaffolding](scaffolding.md) | [Changelog](../../CHANGELOG.md) | [Release Summary Template](release_summary_template.md) | [Start Here](../../START_HERE.md)

## Purpose

Tracks only pending roadmap work. Completed history is in [CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md). Each phase is sized as Adaptive Tier 1–2; split before implementing if a checklist item is Tier 3.

**Rules:**
- Keep only open todo items here.
- Move completed implementation history to CHANGELOG.md in concise form.
- Each phase links back (`why →`) to the finding that justifies it.

---

## Parallel Execution Tracks

Work is split across 3 git worktrees that develop in parallel and merge back to `v87` after each phase. `v87` is the clean integration branch — never commit directly to it.

### Start procedure

Run at the beginning of every new phase, before touching any files:

```bash
cd /home/victor/code/quickscale-wt-track{N}
git status             # must be clean — commit or stash any in-progress work first
git merge v87          # pull in everything other tracks have merged since last sync
# resolve any conflicts, then continue with the phase
```

### Merge procedure

Run when a phase (or a full milestone) is complete and ready to integrate:

```bash
cd /home/victor/code/quickscale-wt-track{N}
git merge v87          # sync latest before merge-back; resolve conflicts here
# run phase verification tests
cd /home/victor/code/quickscale
git merge --no-ff wt-track{N}
```

## Decisions locked

| Finding | Choice |
|---|---|
| 1 — Tenant isolation | **C** — default-scoped manager (contextvar) **+** Postgres RLS backstop |
| 2 — Ownership contract | **A + C** — universal NOT NULL + reserved System org + one teardown policy |
| 3 — Module wiring | **A** — self-describing manifests + generic resolver; delete the `if`-ladder |
| 4 — Routing | **A** — one URL tree: `/crm/...` for both solo and saas; no `/orgs/<slug>/crm/...` |
| 5 — DR | **A** — hard cutover: delete the legacy env-var protocol, single typed adapter |
| F1 — RLS boot guard | Boot-time `rolbypassrls` assertion in orgs `AppConfig.ready()`; fail-fast in saas/prod if connected role has BYPASSRLS — **implemented T1.18** |
| F2 — Unified org scope | Promote `_billing_org_db_context` to `orgs.current_org.org_scope()`; middleware + billing use the shared primitive; phase out manual `all_objects` + filter sites — **implemented T1.19** |

**Global constraints:** no backward compatibility, no migration path, no existing users — every change is a clean break. Drop dead paths outright; squash/rewrite migrations rather than layering compat shims.

## Design decisions (D1–D5)

- **D1 — saas org source.** Content URLs lose `<slug:org_slug>` (Finding 4A). Saas resolves the active org from **session active-org** set by the existing org switcher. Org-admin API may keep `/api/orgs/<slug>/`.
- **D2 — public/anonymous content owner.** With NULL gone, public pages (blog feed, public listings, social links) need an owner. **System org owns published-public content.** Anonymous visitors see System-org rows; solo authed = personal org; saas authed = active org.
- **D3 — teardown policy.** **`on_delete=PROTECT` + explicit `purge_organization` command** (ordered, FK-safe delete) — GDPR-capable, no accidental cascade.
- **D4 — RLS role.** App DB role is `NOSUPERUSER` + `NOBYPASSRLS`; superuser/admin and management commands set `app.current_org_id` or connect under an explicit operator role. Generator settings/templates updated.
- **D5 — migrations.** No users → no data backfill. Rewrite/squash module migrations to the clean NOT NULL contract; delete `null=True`, `isnull` flat-bucket logic, and `/orgs/<slug>/` content routes outright.

## How tasks stay out of Tier 3

A naïve "implement tenant isolation" is `RISK: high` → forced Tier 3. The decomposition below keeps every task **single-concern with contained, single-module blast radius** → `RISK: medium` → floors at Tier 2, never Tier 3. Foundation/shared-contract tasks carry `PLANNING TIER: medium` and should take the plan-review gate; billing and every RLS task get **mandatory** plan-review.

**Conventions for all tasks:**
- Closeout: `validate-and-review` (`Adaptive-quality-gate` → `Adaptive-change-review`).
- Lint/type gate: `make MODULE=<m> lint -- --modules` + `make MODULE=<m> typecheck -- --modules`.
- Branch strategy: one worktree per phase-lane, mirroring the `wt-track1/2/3` flow.

## Open work

### - [ ] D1 — Generated `showcase_react` SaaS org-switch billing parity

`**Tier 2 — Medium | PLANNING TIER: medium | RISK LEVEL: medium | EXECUTION PATH: full-path**`

- **TRACK:** `wt-track1` — after T1.19 merges to v87
- **WHY:** Discovered during T1.17 stop-here closeout. In a generated SaaS project the React SPA performs org-switches client-side but the server session `ACTIVE_ORG_SESSION_KEY` is not explicitly synced before flat `/billing/...` and `/api/billing/...` calls fire. If a billing page loads before session persistence completes the billing views resolve the wrong org from the session.
- **OBJECTIVE:** Decide between two implementation shapes — (A) add an explicit org-switch/session-sync endpoint (`POST /orgs/set-active/`) that the SPA must call and await before navigating to billing, plus billing query invalidation on org change; or (B) remove generated billing entry points from the SPA org dashboard until the session-sync contract exists. Record the choice as a locked decision and implement it in the generated template.
- **SCOPE:**
  - `quickscale_core/src/quickscale_core/generator/templates/themes/showcase_react/templates/index.html.j2` — SPA nav/routing section (lines 77–88); `currentOrgSlug` usage and billing URL construction
  - `quickscale_modules/orgs/` — if Option A: add session-sync view + URL; update middleware/session to write `ACTIVE_ORG_SESSION_KEY` on org-switch POST
  - `quickscale_modules/billing/` — if Option A: billing views validate session org matches request before serving
- **ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:** In a generated SaaS project, navigating billing pages after an org switch always resolves the correct org; no cross-tenant billing data is served. If Option B: billing link is absent from the SPA nav until the contract ships.
- **VALIDATION PATH:** Manual test in a generated SaaS project — switch org, load billing dashboard, confirm correct org is active. `make MODULE=billing test -- --modules` + `make MODULE=orgs test -- --modules`.
- **DEPENDS:** T1.19 merged to v87. Decision required before implementation starts.
- **RECOMMENDATION:** **Pursue** — active functional gap in generated SaaS projects. Option B is the safer quick fix while a session-sync contract is designed.

### Explicitly out of scope

Single-PR items that do not change the design:

- Orphaned `apply-recovery.yml` cleanup after a crashed final state-write.
- Pinning the Stripe SDK `api_version` as a one-liner.
- Missing `list_filter`/`select_related` in individual admin classes.
- Individual `pragma: no cover` lines.
